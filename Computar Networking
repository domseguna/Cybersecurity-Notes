# Module 3: Communication and Protocols

## Module Objectives
- Understand the role of protocols in data networks.
- Learn how communication occurs across a network.
- Describe the interaction between protocols and the layered model.
- Analyze the structure of protocol data units (PDUs).

---

## üåê What Is Communication in Networking?
Communication is the exchange of data between two or more devices.

For successful communication, devices must:
- Agree on rules (protocols)
- Use common languages (data formats)
- Understand addressing (source/destination)

---

## üìú What Are Protocols?
Protocols are rules and standards that define how data is transmitted.

**Examples:**
- HTTP: Web traffic
- TCP/UDP: Transport layer protocols
- IP: Routing and addressing
- Ethernet: Local data transmission
- DNS: Name to IP resolution

## üß± Networking Models

### 1. OSI Model

| Layer | Name         | Purpose                          |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| 7     | Application  | Interfaces with user             |
| 6     | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption      |
| 5     | Session      | Establish/maintain sessions      |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end communication (TCP)  |
| 3     | Network      | Routing, logical addressing      |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing, switching        |
| 1     | Physical     | Cables, NICs, transmission       |

### 2. TCP/IP Model

| Layer         | Function                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Application   | Applications and protocols      |
| Transport     | TCP/UDP                        |
| Internet      | IP addressing & routing         |
| Network Access| Physical & Data Link            |

## üì¶ Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

| OSI Layer   | PDU Name  |
|-------------|-----------|
| Application | Data      |
| Transport   | Segment   |
| Network     | Packet    |
| Data Link   | Frame     |
| Physical    | Bits      |

---

## üîÅ Encapsulation & De-Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation (Sender Side):**  
  Data is passed down the OSI layers.  
  Each layer adds a header (and sometimes trailer).

- **De-Encapsulation (Receiver Side):**  
  Data is passed up the OSI layers.  
  Each layer removes its header to read the data.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Communication Types

- **Unicast:** One-to-one  
- **Broadcast:** One-to-all  
- **Multicast:** One-to-many (specific group)

---

## üß∞ Key Protocol Examples

| Protocol | Layer     | Purpose                       |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| HTTP     | Application | Web communication            |
| FTP      | Application | File transfer               |
| DNS      | Application | Domain to IP resolution     |
| DHCP     | Application | Auto IP assignment          |
| TCP      | Transport   | Reliable delivery           |
| UDP      | Transport   | Fast, connectionless delivery|
| IP       | Network     | Logical addressing & routing |
| Ethernet | Data Link   | Local frame delivery via MAC |

## üìù Summary
- Networks use layered models to simplify communication.  
- Protocols ensure devices speak the same language.  
- Data is encapsulated with headers/trailers at each layer.  
- Different protocols work at different layers to achieve reliable and flexible communication.
